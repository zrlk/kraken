Partial evaluation of the layout. `Executable.addrOf` names the address of
the directive at an index; `Executable.label_addrOf` computes a label's
address and `Executable.directivesFromAddress_addrOf` cuts the directive list
at an index whose address is fresh, so one `simp` with these two equations
rewrites a straightline judgment's segment into a literal directive list.
`Executable.ValidLayout` packages the facts that make the addresses
well-behaved: labels occupy no bytes, every other directive occupies at least
one, and the program fits in the address space; `addrOf_ne_of_valid`
discharges the freshness hypothesis at any index that follows a non-label
directive.

/-! ## Valid layouts -/

/-- The facts about a laid-out executable that keep its addresses
well-behaved: labels occupy no bytes, every other directive occupies at least
one, and the program fits in the address space. Distinct cut points that
follow a non-label directive then sit at distinct addresses
(`addrOf_ne_of_valid`).

An `.align n` directive (the no-op `nopalign n _`) pads to the next multiple
of `n`: the address behind its cell is a multiple of `n`. Like any other
non-label directive it occupies at least one byte, so where an assembler would
pad nothing this layout pads `n` bytes. An alignment of zero constrains
nothing. Absurd alignments (say, several cells aligned to `2 ^ 63`) can leave
a program with no valid layout at all, which makes every theorem about it
vacuous; a proof that relies on alignment should exhibit one. -/
