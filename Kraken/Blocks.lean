The text of a program, as the control-flow rule reads it. `Layout.frag` names
a fragment as it is laid out at a position of its host program.
`Program.fromLabel` is the scope suffix at a label: the text from the label's
cell on. `Program.view` parses the text once into the label-free entry segment
and one `(label, body)` pair per label cell; `Program.blockAt` reads a block
off that decomposition, and `cfg_cases` splits a control-flow obligation into
one goal per block.

/-! ### Fragments

`Layout.frag` names a fragment as it is laid out at a position of its host
program. Extraction lemmas end in `Layout.frag` terms, and `Program.wp_sound`
transports a fragment's wp at them. -/

/-- The fragment `p` as it is laid out from position `n` of the program that
contains it: each directive paired with the size the layout assigns to its
position. -/

/-! ### Runs

`wp` on `Program` is the run: a fall-through past the end of the text lands in
`Q`, and a jump exit at label `l` either surfaces in `E l` or, when `l` is a
label of the program, re-enters at that label's cell. The re-entry closure is
a least fixpoint, taken by `Eventually` inside the definition; no statement
mentions it. -/

`Program.view` cuts the text at its label cells; `Program.blockAt` is the
partial map from a label to its block: the label-free body there, and the
label of the block that follows. `Program.cfg` verifies the whole program
from one spec table `T` and one variant `var`: one triple per block, where an
exit to a textually later block is free and only a back edge must decrease
the variant. -/

`(label, body)` pair per label cell, with label-free bodies. The block map and

/-- For the block-map equation `h : Program.blockAt p l = _` of a closed text
`p`, add `n : (Program.view p).2 = bs`, where `bs` lists the labeled blocks of
`p` with their directives. For the text `[.label "a", i₁, .label "b", i₂]`,
`bs` is `[("a", [i₁]), ("b", [i₂])]`. The kernel checks the equation. -/

/-- Split the control-flow obligations into one goal per block: compute the
block map on the program's text, case on the label it matches, and substitute
the block it names. The bracket lists the program's definitional unfoldings.
In each goal, a jump exit asks whether its target is mapped and at which
position through the list of labels, `["start", ".loop", …]`. Once vcgen
supplies the target, `grind` evaluates that question with the `MachineWP`
normalization rules. -/
